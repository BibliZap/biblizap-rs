Pole dancing for fitness: The physiological and metabolic demand of a 60-minute class. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2704-2710, 2019-Little is understood about the acute physiological or metabolic demand of pole dancing classes. As such, the aims of this study were to quantify the demands of a standardized recreational pole dancing class, classifying outcomes according to American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) exercise-intensity guidelines, and to explore differences in physiological and metabolic measures between skill- and routine-based class components. Fourteen advanced-level amateur female pole dancers completed three 60-minute standardized pole dancing classes. In one class, participants were fitted with a portable metabolic analysis unit. Overall, classes were performed at a mean VO2 of 16.0 ml·kg·min, total energy cost (EC) of 281.6 kcal (4.7 kcal·min), metabolic equivalent (METs) of 4.6, heart rate of 131 b·min, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of 6.3/10, and blood lactate of 3.1 mM. When comparing skill- and routine-based components of the class, EC per minute (4.4 vs. 5.3 kcal·min), peak VO2 (21.5 vs. 29.6 ml·kg·min), METs (4.3 vs. 5.2), and RPE (7.2 vs. 8.4) were all greater in the routine-based component (p < 0.01), indicating that classes with an increased focus on routine-based training, as compared to skill-based training, may benefit those seeking to exercise at a higher intensity level, resulting in greater caloric expenditure. In accordance with ASCM guidelines, an advanced-level 60-minute pole dancing class can be classified as a moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise; when completed for ≥30 minutes, ≥5 days per week (total ≥150 minutes) satisfies the recommended level of exercise for improved health and cardiorespiratory fitness.","scholarly_citations_count":13},{"lens_id":"050-708-976-791-252","title":"Oxygen cost of dynamic or isometric exercise relative to recruited muscle mass","year_published":2006,"external_ids":[{"type":"pmid","value":"16965630"},{"type":"coreid","value":"4058969"},{"type":"doi","value":"10.1186/1476-5918-5-9"},{"type":"pmcid","value":"pmc1579205"},{"type":"magid","value":"1916289376"}],"authors":[{"first_name":"Christopher P.","last_name":"Elder","initials":"CP","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"2331118735"}],"affiliations":[{"name":"University of Georgia","name_original":" Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA; ","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165733156"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.213876.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007699"},{"type":"ror","value":"00te3t702"}],"grid_id":"grid.213876.9","country_code":"US"}]},{"first_name":"Edward T.","last_name":"Mahoney","initials":"ET","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"2140349008"}],"affiliations":[{"name":"University of Georgia","name_original":"Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, USA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165733156"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.213876.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007699"},{"type":"ror","value":"00te3t702"}],"grid_id":"grid.213876.9","country_code":"US"}]},{"first_name":"Christopher D.","last_name":"Black","initials":"CD","ids":[{"type":"orcid","value":"0000-0003-2662-8341"},{"type":"magid","value":"2472402502"}],"affiliations":[{"name":"University of Georgia","name_original":"Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, USA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165733156"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.213876.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007699"},{"type":"ror","value":"00te3t702"}],"grid_id":"grid.213876.9","country_code":"US"}]},{"first_name":"Jill M.","last_name":"Slade","initials":"JM","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"2108161938"}],"affiliations":[{"name":"University of Georgia","name_original":"Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, USA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165733156"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.213876.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007699"},{"type":"ror","value":"00te3t702"}],"grid_id":"grid.213876.9","country_code":"US"}]},{"first_name":"Gary A.","last_name":"Dudley","initials":"GA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"2160347634"}],"affiliations":[{"name":"University of Georgia","name_original":"Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, USA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"165733156"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.213876.9"},{"type":"fundref","value":"100007699"},{"type":"ror","value":"00te3t702"}],"grid_id":"grid.213876.9","country_code":"US"},{"name":"Shepherd Center","name_original":"Crawford Research Institute, Shepherd Center, Atlanta, USA","ids":[{"type":"magid","value":"2800610419"},{"type":"grid","value":"grid.419148.1"},{"type":"ror","value":"035hd8d68"}],"grid_id":"grid.419148.1","country_code":"US"}]}],"source":{"title":"Dynamic medicine : DM","type":"Journal","publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issn":[{"type":"electronic","value":"14765918"}],"country":"United Kingdom","asjc_codes":["2732","1314"],"asjc_subjects":["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine","Physiology"]},"abstract":"Background\r\nOxygen cost of different muscle actions may be influenced by different recruitment and rate coding strategies.
